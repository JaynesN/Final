    <p>JRWI or Just Roll With It is a podcast I have been listening to recently, and I think its preetty good, if you enjoy D&D and/or storytelling, this is certainly a must listen. Currently these are the four youtubers who made the podcast.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Slimecicle</li>
    <li>bizly</li>
    <li>Condifiction</li>
    <li>GrizzlyPlays</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, im listening to the riptide campaign, which is run by GrizzlyPlays and has the characters; Gillion Tidestrider, Chip, and Jay.</p>
<p>They are seriously funny and I definitely suggest checking it out if you sound interested.</p>
